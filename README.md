//week 1 //
Excited! this Business Women who launch and leading couple of companies, is returning the class! guess who is came back? Hadeel
the 14-years-old the school girl, an introvert shy girl. 
Well! if just felt like me. smart one is here too.
Coding nightmares just started in the 3rd day.I desided to talk to the instructor to know was is going on!


//Week 2 //
ِExhausted! Setting for more than 7 hours daily and felt behind. The challenge is inside me. I am enforced to do it in a certain way. Believe the way you want, do it the way you want it is your progress not theirs. In the last day, I was at the collapse edge. Respect the quit moment as if it was part of the progress. But you have to know why you are quiting..be honest with yourself. If it is something about you or related to the others and find your own way.  
P.s.Coding nightmare stopped. 

//Week 3 //
Adaptable! I found my way. There is always a space we can share. Respect and acceptance. 

// Week 4//
Worried! get back the self-esteem. Sometime I felt like thrown in the middle of the ocean despite knowing I am sure I will do it. And I did it!

//week 5//
Well! it is somthing look like life.
